  "faq": {
    "q1": "How do consumers pay merchants with crypto and how private and secure are the transactions?",
    "a1": "Consumers pay by scanning a wallet QR code; the transaction is recorded on the blockchain. Privacy depends on the blockchain used—Bitcoin and Lightning offer pseudonymity, not full anonymity.",
    "q2": "What is and why run a crypto node, how difficult is it to run, including updating, what is the incentive and what are the costs involved?",
    "a2": "A crypto node validates and relays transactions, supporting network integrity. It's not difficult with automated software; costs involve electricity, uptime, and hardware, with rewards or fees as incentives.",
    "q3": "What is a mobile phone crypto node and a laptop crypto node and what supported crypto node options exist?",
    "a3": "A mobile or laptop node is a lightweight version that connects to the network but doesn't store full blockchain data. BW supports full, pruned, and lightweight nodes depending on device capacity.",
    "q4": "How much profit can be made running a crypto node in the BW Network and what's the commitment policy?",
    "a4": "Profit depends on node uptime, transaction volume, and network usage. BW has no fixed return or lock-in period; earnings vary with network activity and fees collected.",
    "q5": "Is BW competitive to traditional crypto payment gateway services and why would merchants prefer our system?",
    "a5": "BW removes intermediaries and settles directly on-chain or via Lightning. Merchants avoid high gateway fees and delays but assume responsibility for managing their own wallets and conversions.",
    "q6": "What are the benefits and how quick is the settlement time for a merchant/customer transaction on the Lightning network?",
    "a6": "Lightning Network transactions settle within seconds. It enables instant, low-fee micropayments with finality once confirmed.",
    "q7": "If traditional merchant transaction processing settlement takes 30+ days, what is the final settlement time and fairness level for all merchants on BW's system?",
    "a7": "Settlement on BW is immediate once the blockchain confirms payment. All merchants receive funds directly without intermediaries, so fairness depends on network rules, not a central authority.",
    "q8": "What cryptocurrencies does BW support now and what will be supported in the near future?",
    "a8": "BW currently supports Bitcoin and Lightning-based payments. Future integrations will depend on node compatibility, network stability, and regulatory compliance.",
    "q9": "Why does this system only support final transaction settlement to the merchant's wallet versus to currency?",
    "a9": "Because BW operates as a decentralized payment protocol, not a fiat exchange. It transfers crypto directly to the merchant's wallet, avoiding custodial and regulatory obligations.",
    "q10": "How many merchant stores can be set up on one node and how many crypto nodes can a business run?",
    "a10": "Multiple stores can operate under one node, limited by hardware and bandwidth. Businesses can run multiple nodes if they want to distribute load or operate in different locations.",
    "q11": "Does BW perform KYC on Qualifying BW Customers and who's responsible for KYC with onboarded merchants?",
    "a11": "BW performs KYC where legally required, primarily for network-level participants. Merchants remain responsible for customer KYC or AML compliance within their jurisdictions.",
    "q12": "What accounting/metrics are provided and does BW's system have support for merchant's proprietary POS terminal integration?",
    "a12": "BW provides transaction logs, balance summaries, and node performance metrics. POS integration is supported through APIs and plugin modules, depending on merchant system compatibility.",
    "q13": "What are the advantages of running on-premises, a powerful workstation/server for the decentralized AI Module and what happens if the crypto nodes cannot reach it?",
    "a13": "Running on-premises provides faster processing, full data control, and independence from cloud reliance. If unreachable, nodes continue operating with limited functionality until reconnected.",
    "q14": "Why did BW include AI and automation in its 12 patent-pending technologies and business model?",
    "a14": "AI and automation handle dynamic network optimization, predictive analytics, and fraud detection. They reduce manual management and improve system efficiency.",
    "q15": "Why would someone 'Help Fund Developing Country Businesses' and who does this really help?",
    "a15": "It channels crypto liquidity into real businesses that lack traditional financing. The funding supports local economic growth while giving contributors measurable social and financial impact."
